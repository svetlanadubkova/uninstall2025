 Create a single-page interactive art piece called "UNINSTALL 2025.EXE" - a meditative year-end experience styled as a Windows software uninstallation wizard.

  AESTHETIC (CRITICAL - MUST MATCH EXACTLY):
  - Font: Times New Roman, italic, serif
  - Colors: Pure white background (#FFFFFF), bright red text (#FF0000)
  - Borders: 1px solid red lines
  - Style: Minimalist, glitchy, internet-art, early web nostalgia
  - Animations: Subtle glitch effects (text shifts, hue rotations, scanlines), slow marquees, fade-ins
  - NO gradients, NO shadows (except intentional glitch text-shadow), NO modern UI elements
  - Inspiration: Brutalist web design, memento mori aesthetic, performance art

  TONE (CRITICAL):
  - all lowercase except for EMPHASIS and when things get MANIC
  - vulnerable, earnest, honest, romantic, a little unhinged
  - not inspirational - REAL. performance art. screaming truth into the void with hope.
  - emoticons okay :-)
  - capital letters for intensity: AFFIRM!!!!! LFG!!!
  - sometimes keyboard smashing when emotions overflow
  - like a friend texting you at 2am with realizations
  - "God's Not Finished" always capitalized like this when used

  CORE EXPERIENCE - SCREEN FLOW:

  1. INTRO SCREEN (full-screen, centered)
     - Large italic text: "UNINSTALL 2025.EXE"
     - Subtitle: "are you ready to let go?"
     - Bottom: "click anywhere to begin"
     - Subtle glitch animation on text

  2. PREPARING SCREEN
     - "preparing to uninstall 2025.exe..."
     - Scrolling marquee of the year's chaos: "heartbreak waiting growing breaking learning loving losing finding planting seeds trusting timing crying laughing wanting hoping doubting believing..."
     - Progress bar (red fill, white background, 1px red border)
     - Auto-advances after 3 seconds

  3. USER IDENTIFICATION
     - "enter your name to continue:"
     - Simple text input (red border, white bg, red text)
     - [continue] button
     - Validates name exists before advancing

  4. UNINSTALLATION WIZARD - Sequential screens (click to advance):
     - Progress indicator at top ("step 3 of 14")
     - Main message/lesson in center
     - Loading bar or status text
     - [next] or [continue] button at bottom

     SCREEN CONTENT (raw, unfiltered tone):

     Screen A: "removing temporary files..."
     → "temporary files served their purpose in this version. sometimes you delete to make space for an upgrade. sometimes you delete to make space for something new. but holding on to them slows the system and processes down. clearing space for what's next..."

     Screen B: "analyzing installed programs..."
     → "you learned how humans work better this year. including yourself. especially yourself. you're not the same person who started this year. AFFIRM!!!!!"

     Screen C: "scanning for corrupted narratives..."
     → "whose story are you living? theirs or yours? you know yourself best. TRUST YOURSELF."

     Screen D: "ERROR: cannot delete hope.exe - file is protected"
     → Fake Windows error dialog box style
     → "some things refuse to be uninstalled. God's Not Finished. there are so many tomorrows you haven't seen yet. so many people you haven't met. so many versions of yourself you haven't become."

     Screen E: "archiving lessons learned..."
     → "THE DAY YOU PLANT THE SEED IS NOT THE DAY YOU EAT THE FRUIT. don't forget everything you planted this year. you watered things in the dark. the garden remembers. the universe is keeping score. even the smallest seeds bloom one day. your seeds are still growing even if you can't see them yet KEEP PLANTING KEEP TRUSTING KEEP GOINGkjhsdfgjkhsdfg :-)"

     Screen F: "removing broken shortcuts..."
     → "heartbreak redirected you. rejection protected you. stop trying to get back on the path. there is no path. you can always change direction. you're not stuck - you're just scared. you're not a tree - MOVE!!!! pivot. start over. for the love of God, don't be a coward. there are no shortcuts, darling."

     Screen G: "WARNING: patience.exe is still processing..."
     → "not everything blooms on your timeline and that's okay. you're allowed to want things before they arrive. desire is life-affirming. you don't have to be patient perfectly. you just have to keep going. God's Not Finished."

     Screen H: "scanning for corrupted files..."
     → "you speedran through love and heartbreak and growth and that's GOOD actually. you didn't run. you stayed present, open, vulnerable, and earnest even when it hurt. tomorrow is a beautiful thing. LFG :-)"

     Screen I: "defragmenting memories..."
     → "you're not who you were in january. you're not who you'll be in december 2026. you're always becoming. you're always shedding skin. you're a different person every 4 weeks and that's the whole point. shedding is never comfortable. growth is supposed to feel like this."

     **Screen J: INTERACTIVE DESKTOP SCREEN** (SPECIAL - see detailed specs below)

     Screen K: "compressing 2025..."
     → Choice moment: "save these lessons?"
     → Three buttons: [yes] [always] [already saved in my bones]
     → Any choice shows: "good. you'll need them later."

     Screen L: "ERROR: cannot install cynicism.exe - blocked by hope.dll"
     → Fake error dialog
     → "you could close off. you could decide love isn't worth it. you could build walls. but you won't. because you're not a coward. LFG :-)"

     Screen M: Multiple ERROR messages cascade (auto-advance through each):
     → "ERROR: cannot delete love.exe - access denied"
     → "ERROR: cannot remove hope.dll - system file protected by God's Not Finished"
     → "ERROR: cannot uninstall faith.sys - required by future.exe"
     → "ERROR: cannot remove growth.dll - permanently installed"
     → Final: "some things aren't meant to be uninstalled :-)"

  5. TRANSITION SCREEN

     - "preparing to install 2026.exe..."
     - "do your part. release the rest."

     - Messages appear: "removing resentment.sys...", "deleting fear-of-failure.exe..."
     - GOOD files remain on desktop and start glowing/pulsing slightly

     - Text: "all corrupted files removed. continue →"
     - Click advances to next wizard screen

  **VISUAL STYLE:**
